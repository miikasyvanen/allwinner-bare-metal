This is an experimental branch targeting Orange Pi H3-based boards that adds a lot
of functionality, mostly by including external libraries.

Most libraries are included in the source tree. One external dependency is
lib-h3 from https://github.com/vanvught/rpidmx512. You will have to check
out that repository and change the variable LIBH3DIR in the Makefile
accordingly.

lib-h3 contains many drivers that are more full-featured than the bare-bones
implementations here, and it is likely that those will slowly replace the existing
drivers in this repository.

Original README:

This repository represents an attempt to run bare metal code on an Allwinner SoC.

Current target is the H3. This code will implement drivers for all hardware used
with the exception of DRAM which is initialized by u-boot SPL.
