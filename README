This is an experimental branch targeting Orange Pi H3-based boards that adds a lot
of functionality, mostly by including external libraries.

Original README:

This repository represents an attempt to run bare metal code on an Allwinner SoC.

Current target is the H3. This code will implement drivers for all hardware used
with the exception of DRAM which is initialized by u-boot SPL.
